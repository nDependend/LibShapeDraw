 * Demonstrates a couple basic things you can do with events:
 * 1) automatically clear all shapes owned by this mod when respawning; and
 * 2) dynamically create and update shapes, in this case based off the player's
 *    position
 * <p>
 * This mod implements the LSDEventListener interface itself, though you could
 * easily refactor this to use a different class in your mod.
