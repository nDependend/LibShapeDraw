/**
 * Dynamically create animated shapes.
 * <p>
 * Pressing V on the keyboard will spawn a rotating wireframe box near the
 * player, colored randomly and rotating at a random rate. An unlimited number
 * of boxes can be created. The shapes, and their associated looping
 * animations, are properly cleaned up when respawning.
 * <p>
 * This illustrates an important concept: animations (a.k.a. Trident Timeline
 * instances) are NOT owned by the LibDrawShapes API instance. You, as the mod
 * author, own them and are responsible for cleaning up after them if their
 * associated Shape is removed.
 * <p>
 * In other words: LibShapeDraw and Trident will not automatically stop any
 * looping animation that you start.
 * <p>
 * As noted in mod_LSDDemoTridentBasic, it's relatively harmless to have a few
 * looping animations running at all times, especially if their associated
 * Shapes exist at all times anyway.
 * <p>
 * But if the Shape is going away, you don't want an active looping animation
 * to keep updating it. This wastes CPU and is a minor memory leak: the Shape
 * won't ever get garbage collected as it's still referenced internally by the
 * animation engine.
 * <p>
 * You don't have to consider any of this for non-looping animations. Once
 * complete, animations are dereferenced by the animation engine and will be
 * eventually garbage collected without issue.
