Installation instructions for @libshapedraw.name@ v@libshapedraw.version@ [@minecraft.version@]:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, make sure that either LiteLoader or Forge is installed.
LibShapeDraw is compatible with either.

Next, download the jar and move it to the versioned `mods` directory.  This is simply a subdirectory under `mods` named after the Minecraft version desired.  For example, jars for Minecraft @minecraft.version@ are placed under `mods/@minecraft.version@/`.
